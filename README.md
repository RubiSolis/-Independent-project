# Independent-proyect
Hello, my name is Rubi Solis. I'm studying computer science and am currently in my second year
This project is completely independent and was born from a desire to apply what I learned at university, explore beyond the academic program, and address a real need.

What is it about? 
This is a design of a digital solution for a micro-business of crafts, which includes
1.Relational database model 
2.A web application 
3.Features for managing product,purchases, customers and orders 

the goal is for company to:
1.Manage its inventory 
2.Receive orders 
3.Automate records and operations 
4.have a functional web presence for its potential customers

WWhat will you find in this repository?
Within the different folders, you can explore how to create your own system from scratch:

* Database model (diagrams, relationships, primary/foreign keys)
* Object-oriented modeling with classes and methods
* (Coming soon) Web interface for clients and administrators

+ Step-by-step documentation so you can adapt it to your own idea or business
